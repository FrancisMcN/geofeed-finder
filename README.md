# geofeed-finder

This utility discovers and retrieves geofeed files from whois data according to [draft-ymbk-opsawg-finding-geofeeds](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ymbk-opsawg-finding-geofeeds/).

To use the compiled version, see [releases](https://github.com/massimocandela/geofeed-finder/releases/). 
Otherwise, you can just download the code and do `npm insttall` and `npm run serve` to run it.

The utility automatically manages the cache according to what described in the draft (so you can just run it how many times you like).
